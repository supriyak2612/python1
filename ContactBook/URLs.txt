Project Overview
To build your contact book application, you need to organize the code into modules and packages and give your project a coherent structure. In this tutorial, you’ll use the following directories and files structure:

rpcontacts_project/
│
├── rpcontacts/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── views.py
│   ├── database.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── model.py
│
├── requirements.txt

└── rpcontacts.py
Here’s a brief summary of the contents of your project directory:

rpcontacts_project/ is the project’s root directory. It’ll contain the following files:
requirements.txt provides the project’s requirements list.
README.md provides general information about the project.
rpcontacts.py provides the entry-point script to run the application.
rpcontacts/ is a subdirectory that provides the application’s main package. It provides the following modules:
